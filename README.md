# EventSystem
this project is 12th grade final project.
the project is an event system for students that each student will see their own relevant events and when they happen.
the system logic is like that - every student has groups and can be assigned to groups and every event has a group that the event is for,
the groups are inside of another so that each group is sort of inside of each other so that if a student is assigned to 12th grade class 2 he will get the events for his
own group and also the events for 12th grade and school.
this is a presentation of a tree view that is inside the website to best present the idea.
